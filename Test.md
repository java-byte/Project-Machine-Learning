## How would you describe the difference between gradient descent and normal equations as two methods of fitting a linear regression?

First of all let's understand what is `Linear Regression`

#### Linear Regression:

Regression is a method of modelling a target value `Y` based on independent predictors `X`. Regression techniques mostly differ based on the number of independent variables and the type of relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
